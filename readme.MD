# Dynamic testing basic Env for your Smart Contracts Audit

This is specific environment we use for running Solidity tests in the form of a Docker image that you can download and run on your project.

<br>

## Prerequisites

- Smart contracts
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install) installed and running (as a daemon)


<br>

## Typical environment we use for testing

- Environment
	- Ethereum blockchain
	- Solidity, Truffle
	- Mocha/Chai as testing framework
	
- Projects folders 	
	-  `/contracts` folder with smart contracts
	-  `/test` folder with tests

- Project files:
	-  `Migration.sol`, `1_initial_migration.js`, `2_deploy_contracts.js` for truffle migration
	-  `truffle.js` with networks settings
	-  `package.json` with dependencies and scripts

- Networks 
	- Testrpc, Ganache or Parity for testing
	- Kovan/Ropsten/Rinkeby testnetwork with Infura

<br>

## Installation and running

1. Download/clone/fork this repository.
- Copy `npm` commands from this repo's `package.json` to your project.
- Copy `testAll.sh` from this repo to your project.
- Go to you project folder that contains `/contracts` and `/test` folders.
	- Run `npm run blaTest` for dynamic testing
	- Run `npm run blaCoverage` for test coverage report
	- Run `npm run blaGas` for gas spending report
	- Run `npm run blaAll`  for simultaneous testing. Results will be printed to the same named files in the  `/audit` folder
	- Run `npm run blaPlay` to have your playground inside the container
		
		> There are VI and nano editors installed, so, feel free to change something, help yourself, its all yours. <br>
		> Press `Cntrl-D` to exit container.


Each run of these commands will create new Docker container, copy your contracts and tests from the project directory to the containerâ€™s volume and then run tests in our typical testing environment. Containers are self destroying on exit.

## Updating your environment configuration

If your tests are not working in our environment, we need to figure out *Why* and change the environment. 
It will take some time. You can save that (paid) time and update the configuration by yourself:

1. Go to the `/docker` folder.
- Update the `package.json` with new dependencies from **your** `package.json`, but keep it clean from unused dependencies (such as frontend packages, webpack configs and so on).
- Check *dockerfile* and update it if needed.
- Build new docker image: `docker build -t yourcompanyname/projectname` from **`/docker` folder**.
- Check that new Docker image is ready by running it in your **project folder**: `docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd)/contracts:/audit/contracts -v $(pwd)/test:/audit/test yourcompanyname/projectname` with parameters you need.


<br>

## Send us your configuration

We will rebuild the Docker image by ourselves, so please send us:

- `dockerfile` (or files)
- `package.json` 
	- only dependencies for the testing, not all of your dependencies
	- your `package.json` scripts section
- `truffle.js` with your networks congiguration

Push it back to the Github if you forked this repo before or achive it with zip/tar.

Send us the link to that commit (or .zip file)
